\begin{abstract}
This template provides instructions for your final PBL report. The abstract must be a concise yet comprehensive reflection of what your project is about. In particular, the abstract must be self-contained, without abbreviations, footnotes, or references. It should be a microcosm of the full report, describing the problem, solution, technical summary of the prototype and how it was tested.

\textbf{KEYWORDS} Enter a list of keywords or phrases in alphabetical order, separated by commas.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background Information}
Analytical description of the problem situation presented at the beginning of the project work. Scale of the problem.

\subsection{Problem Finding}
Describe the path from the starting point stated above, through detailed research on the general problem to the narrowed specific problem description.

\section{Idea Finding}

\subsection{State of the Art}
Research on existing knowledge and solutions in relation to the specific problem defined above. This section will contain the most links to scientific articles or websites of commercial solutions. Include the references in square brackets: [1]. For a complete discussion of references and their formats, see the IEEE style manual at www.ieee.org/authortools.

\subsection{Innovative Ideas}
Ideas developed by your team, adding new value to better address the stated problem, possibly leading to more effective solutions.

\subsection{Main Idea Selection and Justification}
Which of the above ideas your team finds the most worth developing and why?

    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

\section{Solution Implementation}
Summarize your solution before discussing the technical details of the prototyping process.

\subsection{Technical Details}
Details of putting the selected idea into life e.g. in form of a material or virtual prototype. Reference figures using phrases such as "...as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:example} and Table \ref{tab:example}"

\section{Ways of Verification}
How your team plans to verify (or has already verified) if your solution effectively solves the problem?

    \label{tab:example}
\end{table}

\section{Conclusions and Perspectives}
Summarize your work, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of its results. How do you see a potential follow-up of the project?

\section*{Appendix}
Appendixes, if needed, appear before the acknowledgment. This is a good place to place a link to code or data repositories online. Possibly a youtube clip of a demonstration of your prototype solution.

\section*{Acknowledgment}
A place to thank the supervisor, experts, organization and/or sponsors that helped with your project.
